# Eeshan Mahmud - Portfolio

## Project Description
In this project I started with the design for portfolio done in UX I class using **Adobe XD**. I the goal is to create the design into a functional website to showcase my work and skills.

## Challenge
One of the major challenges I faced while working on this project was aligning and positioning contents effectively on the webpage, especially with complex layouts.

## Lesson Learned
 Creating this web portfolio was a good learning experience. The challenge of aligning and positioning content provided me with valuable skills in CSS techniques for layout design. Through trial and error, I realized the significance of using bootstrap grid systems to achieve most of the desired layout across various devices and sizes.
